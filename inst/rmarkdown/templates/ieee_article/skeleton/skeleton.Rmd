## R Markdown

<!-- Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
 and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word. -->
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a "starter file"
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
<!-- You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
(should never be an issue)-->
I wish you the best of success.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R `r try(author)` Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
