# Introduction



<!-- Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
 and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word. -->
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo is intended to serve as a "starter file"
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
<!-- You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
(should never be an issue)-->
I wish you the best of success.
