## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown `r citet(meeker)` is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a `r citet(meeker2)` document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r results='asis'}
knitcitations::write.bibtex()
#lapply(X = citations, FUN = function(X) WriteBib(X, append = F))
bibliography()
```
